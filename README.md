S3858024

I was born in Brisbane and grew up in Brisbane North. I graduated high school in 2006 and started working at EB Games while completing a Diploma in Justice. I worked a bit in security and then worked with the Australian Taxation Office in Facilities Management. 

## Interests in IT

Growing up I was always interested in IT and a space nerd. Mum took me to get my first computer (which my sister got jealous) and from there got a real understanding and hobby learning about computers and software programs.  

My first real taste of IT was one and  of my early jobs at a data centre where i worked in security.  I was so fascinated by what each little piece of equipment did and the people working there seemed to love what they did.  

From there I found a passion for the legal system and completed a Diploma in Justice while also working at the tax office and hoping to become a police officer. As life progressed I realised back to my original passion I wanted to work in IT. 

What lead me to RMIT initially was looking at lots of University's with a focus of IT and flexability with distance. Upon looking at reviews, RMIT looked most suitable to what my needs were and focus for what I'm studying. 

Two intersting thing about me is when I was younger I was a junior champion in tennis and I once fell off a horse and broke both my wrists. 

## Ideal Job

[Database Administrator](https://www.seek.com.au/job/41161610?type=standout#searchRequestToken=096db453-996f-4182-b5b1-909a9f96e03a) This link will take you to my chosen career in seek. 

As you can see, my chosen career is a Database Administrator (DBA). 
The role and in general with Database Administrators involes the integrity and security of the company's database (the internet police). They analyse data incoming and outgoing. Make sure backups are running smoothly and troubleshoot any issues that arise. 

The role appeals to me in that it's somewhat familiar with my past jobs in maintaining a wide level of different legislation and work policies and outlining these practises to staff. It also brings together my Diploma in Justice to create an understanding of security protocols surrounding database. 

Qualifcations for this career: 

| Qualification required                    | Qualification currently have  |
| ------------------------                  | -------------------           |
| Bachelor in Information Technology        | Diploma in Justice            |
| Join the Australian Computer Society (ACS)|                               |                           
| Continuing Professional Development (CPD) |                               |

Looking at this chart gives a brief example of the qualifications required for a job as a DBA and ongoing requirement, plus a comparative on the qualifications I currently have which is quite minimal for IT related. The desired academic for a DBA is a Bachelor's in Information Technology and a mininal level of expereince within the field. My advantages while minimal within professional experiences in IT, I have been employed very cloesly to IT professionals and have gained a slight understanding within.  

A great steppingstone into a DBA role is through a IT Helpdesk role. This will give me a entry level job in the IT field and gain professional experience. This can be used later on in my career path for my desired goal. RMIT will give me the educational requirement to apply, while a IT Helpdesk job will give me experience. 

## Personal Profile

The varies results I completed for my personality and learning style are from the list as follows:

* [Myers-Briggs](https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17335/test-results/17049445) - result; E.N.F.J. 
This stands for; Extraversion - Intuition - Feeling - Judging 
  
* [Learning style test](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=2&V=9&T=9-) - result; Auditory: 10% - Visual: 45% - Tactile: 45%

* Creativity test - result; 53 - Above average 

The results from the Myers-Briggs test tells me that I'm an ENFJ (as shown above) these types of people are warm, energetic, forward thinking, visionary, compassionate, ethical, organised and ambitious. The results from the learning Style test shows I remember more things by sight and picture and what Iâ€™m learning in my head. Further, as a tactile learner, I learn better by touching and doing. I remember by things I have done, but difficult remembering what I heard in the process. The creativity tests tell me I have an above average creativity score of 53. 

Looking at my results gives a fair idea how I will manage in many things. A big importance in IT is team related. The above results show I will work well in part of a team as I am compassionate and warm but also great at forward thinking and ambitious. Great qualities for any team related exercise. But further, my influence as part of a team I work well actually seeing the project and being hands on instead of only talking about it with no clear image what it will be. I have to be careful, as I remember more what I see than what I listen to in the process so it will benefit me more but writing notes down (with a picture haha). My learning style also complements my creativity test of above average, so should be able to think outside the box. 

There is no clear strategy to forming a team. I think everyone brings different skills to the group that will benefit as a whole. Some people will clash with similar skills and leadership qualities, but everyone will eventually find common ground. A great step into achieving common ground is to find common interests. This creates friendship bonds and works well to move forward in the task at hand. The results from the 3 tests benefit the individual alone and isn't necessarily a positive in telling everyone their results as I feel some people will expect that person to give 100% in that area and that's not a team quality.

## Project Idea

My project will be based on a software and hardare system that can be fitted to cars that can create a self aware vehicle and can communicate with other vehicles, emergency vehicles, traffic lights, pedestrains. The benifits of this system are that any vehicles can be upgraded to this hardware. Vehicles that are simililiar to this currently and Tesla vehicles. But these vehicles can be quite expensive for the average consumer. To be clear, this will not create a self driving vehicles (autonmous) but give an extra level of safety, security and awareness for what is around you, near you or has been. The codename for this project is...
