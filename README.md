S3858024

I was born in Brisbane and grew up in Brisbane North. I graduated high school in 2006 and started working at EB Games while completing a Diploma in Justice. I worked a bit in security and then worked with the Australian Taxation Office in Facilities Management. 

## Interests in IT

Growing up I was always interested in IT and a space nerd. Mum took me to get my first computer (which my sister got jealous) and from there got a real understanding and hobby learning about computers and software programs.  

My first real taste of IT was one and  of my early jobs at a data centre where i worked in security.  I was so fascinated by what each little piece of equipment did and the people working there seemed to love what they did.  

From there I found a passion for the legal system and completed a Diploma in Justice while also working at the tax office and hoping to become a police officer. As life progressed I realised back to my original passion I wanted to work in IT. 

What lead me to RMIT initially was looking at lots of University's with a focus of IT and flexability with distance. Upon looking at reviews, RMIT looked most suitable to what my needs were and focus for what I'm studying. 

Two intersting thing about me is when I was younger I was a junior champion in tennis and I once fell off a horse and broke both my wrists. 

## Ideal Job

[Database Administrator](https://www.seek.com.au/job/41161610?type=standout#searchRequestToken=096db453-996f-4182-b5b1-909a9f96e03a) This link will take you to my chosen career in seek. 

As you can see, my chosen career is a Database Administrator (DBA). 
The role and in general with Database Administrators involes the integrity and security of the company's database (the internet police). They analyse data incoming and outgoing. Make sure backups are running smoothly and troubleshoot any issues that arise. 

The role appeals to me in that it's somewhat familiar with my past jobs in maintaining a wide level of different legislation and work policies and outlining these practises to staff. It also brings together my Diploma in Justice to create an understanding of security protocols surrounding database. 

Qualifcations for this career: 

| Qualification required                    | Qualification currently have  |
| ------------------------                  | -------------------           |
| Bachelor in Information Technology          | Diploma in Justice            |
| Join the Australian Computer Society (ACS)|                               |                           
| Continuing Professional Development (CPD) |                               |

Looking at this chart gives a brief example of the qualifications required for a job as a DBA and ongoing requirement, plus a comparative on the qualifications I currently have which is quite minimal for IT related. The desired academic for a DBA is a Bachelor's in Information Technology and a mininal level of expereince within the field. My advantages while minimal within professional experiences in IT, I have been employed very cloesly to IT professionals and have gained a slight understanding within.  

A great steppingstone into a DBA role is through a IT Helpdesk role. This will give me a entry level job in the IT field and gain professional experience. This can be used later on in my career path for my desired goal. RMIT will give me the educational requirement to apply, while a IT Helpdesk job will give me experience.
