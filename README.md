I was born in Brisbane and grew up in Brisbane North. I graduated high school in 2006 and started working at EB Games while completing a diploma in Justice. I worked a bit in security and then worked with the Australian Taxation Office in Facilities Management. 

## Interests in IT

Growing up I was always interested in IT and a space nerd. Mum took me to get my first computer (which my sister got jealous) and from there got a real understanding and hobby learning about computers and software programs.  

My first real taste of IT was one and  of my early jobs at a data centre where i worked in security.  I was so fascinated by what each little piece of equipment did and the people working there seemed to love what they did.  

From there I found a passion for the legal system and completed a diploma in Justice while also working at the tax office and hoping to become a police officer. As life progressed I realised back to my original passion I wanted to work in IT. 

What lead me to RMIT initially was looking at lots of University's with a focus of IT and flexability with distance. Upon looking at reviews, RMIT looked most suitable to what my needs were and focus for what I'm studying. 

Two intersting thing about me is when I was younger I was a junior champion in tennis and I once fell off a horse and broke both my wrists.
