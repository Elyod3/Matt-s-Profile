Student number: 
S3858024

I was born in Brisbane and grew up in Brisbane North. I graduated high school in 2006 and started working at EB Games while completing a Diploma in Justice. I worked a bit in security and then worked with the Australian Taxation Office in Facilities Management. 

## Interests in IT

Growing up I was always interested in IT and a space nerd. Mum took me to get my first computer (which my sister got jealous) and from there got a real understanding and hobby learning about computers and software programs.  

My first real taste of IT was one and  of my early jobs at a data centre where i worked in security.  I was so fascinated by what each little piece of equipment did and the people working there seemed to love what they did.  

From there I found a passion for the legal system and completed a Diploma in Justice while also working at the tax office and hoping to become a police officer. As life progressed I realised back to my original passion I wanted to work in IT. 

What lead me to RMIT initially was looking at lots of University's with a focus of IT and flexability with distance. Upon looking at reviews, RMIT looked most suitable to what my needs were and focus for what I'm studying. 

Two intersting thing about me is when I was younger I was a junior champion in tennis and I once fell off a horse and broke both my wrists. 

## Ideal Job

[Database Administrator](https://www.seek.com.au/job/41161610?type=standout#searchRequestToken=096db453-996f-4182-b5b1-909a9f96e03a) This link will take you to my chosen career in seek. 

As you can see, my chosen career is a Database Administrator (DBA). 
The role and in general with Database Administrators involes the integrity and security of the company's database (the internet police). They analyse data incoming and outgoing. Make sure backups are running smoothly and troubleshoot any issues that arise. 

The role appeals to me in that it's somewhat familiar with my past jobs in maintaining a wide level of different legislation and work policies and outlining these practises to staff. It also brings together my Diploma in Justice to create an understanding of security protocols surrounding database. 

Qualifcations for this career: 

| Qualification required                    | Qualification currently have  |
| ------------------------                  | -------------------           |
| Bachelor in Information Technology        | Diploma in Justice            |
| Join the Australian Computer Society (ACS)|                               |                           
| Continuing Professional Development (CPD) |                               |

Looking at this chart gives a brief example of the qualifications required for a job as a DBA and ongoing requirement, plus a comparative on the qualifications I currently have which is quite minimal for IT related. The desired academic for a DBA is a Bachelor's in Information Technology and a mininal level of expereince within the field. My advantages while minimal within professional experiences in IT, I have been employed very cloesly to IT professionals and have gained a slight understanding within.  

A great steppingstone into a DBA role is through a IT Helpdesk role. This will give me a entry level job in the IT field and gain professional experience. This can be used later on in my career path for my desired goal. RMIT will give me the educational requirement to apply, while a IT Helpdesk job will give me experience. 

## Personal Profile

The varies results I completed for my personality and learning style are from the list as follows:

* [Myers-Briggs](https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17335/test-results/17049445) - result; E.N.F.J. 
This stands for; Extraversion - Intuition - Feeling - Judging 
  
* [Learning style test](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=2&V=9&T=9-) - result; Auditory: 10% - Visual: 45% - Tactile: 45%

* Creativity test - result; 53 - Above average 

The results from the Myers-Briggs test tells me that I'm an ENFJ (as shown above) these types of people are warm, energetic, forward thinking, visionary, compassionate, ethical, organised and ambitious. The results from the learning Style test shows I remember more things by sight and picture and what I’m learning in my head. Further, as a tactile learner, I learn better by touching and doing. I remember by things I have done, but difficult remembering what I heard in the process. The creativity tests tell me I have an above average creativity score of 53. 

Looking at my results gives a fair idea how I will manage in many things. A big importance in IT is team related. The above results show I will work well in part of a team as I am compassionate and warm but also great at forward thinking and ambitious. Great qualities for any team related exercise. But further, my influence as part of a team I work well actually seeing the project and being hands on instead of only talking about it with no clear image what it will be. I have to be careful, as I remember more what I see than what I listen to in the process so it will benefit me more but writing notes down (with a picture haha). My learning style also complements my creativity test of above average, so should be able to think outside the box. 

There is no clear strategy to forming a team. I think everyone brings different skills to the group that will benefit as a whole. Some people will clash with similar skills and leadership qualities, but everyone will eventually find common ground. A great step into achieving common ground is to find common interests. This creates friendship bonds and works well to move forward in the task at hand. The results from the 3 tests benefit the individual alone and isn't necessarily a positive in telling everyone their results as I feel some people will expect that person to give 100% in that area and that's not a team quality.

## Project Idea

#### Overview 

My project will be based on a software and hardware system that can be fitted to cars or by downloading an app which create a self-aware vehicle that can communicate with other vehicles, emergency vehicles, traffic lights, pedestrians to create a virtual map which will indicate potential hazards for the driver and also able to create smart traffic lights that do not work on timers for smoother traffic flow. The benefits of this system are that any vehicle can be upgraded to this hardware. Vehicles that are similar to this are currently Tesla’s, but Tesla create vehicles that are partially autonomous with hardware and software integrated within one another. These vehicles can be quite expensive for the average consumer. To be clear, this will not create self-driving vehicles (autonomous) but give an extra level of safety, security and awareness for what is around you or has been. The codename for this project is...

PROJECT EFAS

#### Motivation

There were 1,145 road deaths in 2018 and 38,945 hospitalised injuries in 2016 (BITRE 2019) involving car crashes across Australia. This should motivate anyone trying to find solutions to fix such an underlining issue that effects everyone. The project has a major playing field being used by the public as well as government organisations in that it links everyone together. Integrated by sophisticated software, it be customised to government, personal or general public. Transport agency’s will be interested as traffic flow will be improved reducing unnecessary red light stopping.

#### Description

The main instrument is a quality touch screen that can be fitted into the dash of the vehicle and a small wireless magnetometer and camera lens installed at the front and back of the vehicle. People could be confused with current in-car entertainment screens but couldn't be any different. The main purpose of this was not to add anything in the car that it would already have. The unit links up by a GPS system and with near-by vehicles already with the same system, mobile phones and traffic lights. It uploads data provided by government agencies that could include detailed accidents, weather phenomenon and traffic flow.

Some people would think "well it’s just a Navman" but this is where it gets really interesting. While approaching on the road, its already getting a detailed picture of vehicles around you like a second eye on the road linking the same device in the other vehicle or from their phone by an app which is easier and less expensive but will not give as much detail as the device installed in your car. Still driving but this time it's linking with traffic lights which are calculating numbers coming from all different directions. So, by the time you reach the intersection the traffic lights will know from your speed and distance away.

Talking safety, say if there is a speeding car that is around your area, EFAS will be able to alert you to the situation to keep yourself and family safe. This can be useful for law enforcement agencies to track the vehicle by using traffic lights and your alert system to get a detailed image where the speeding vehicle is going. Another safety feature is that if your car is stolen it can be immobilised. Avoiding potential high speed collections resulting in fatalities.

#### Tools and Technologies

The software and hardware will be integrated within the vehicles Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The software will be incredibly complex. To make things run smooth, we'll need to run a few different programs; the first is Linux, which is an open source operating system. It acts to receive requests from other software and relay it back to the hardware (What is Linux 2019). The hardware has to be adaptable. Every vehicle will have different requirements. For this, customers select their vehicle and model giving them an accurate specification on our website. 

#### Skills Required

   The main part of this will require superb software engineers. Will need to included software written in C++ which is a powerful purpose programming language (Cprogramming n.d.). Software engineers will prototype algorithms in Python, Matlab, or even Java. A Global Positioning System (GPS) will be used to track the EFAS, apps and other hardware eventually used with it. The skills, hardware and software will be difficult to find at first and creating the starting point for the command lines. Suppliers with hardware and chips will be constantly looked at and vendor management to find the right link in our goal. More importantly, it will be about having the government onboard with the project and couldn't be possible without their contribution and support.
   
#### Outcome

If successful, it will see the majority of people having EFAS installed or a minimum downloading the EFAS app. The outcome will be a safer road network that will be constantly improving with new hardware and software upgrades. To which time in the near future, the impact for the development team will see car manufactures provide EFAS as standalone much similar to how we see CarPlay made available. In summary, the high fatality rate will improve with a combination of vehicle technology like EFAS and road network advances over time, but also comes down to driver responsibility.
