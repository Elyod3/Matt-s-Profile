I was born in Brisbane and grew up in Brisbane North. I graduated high school in 2006 and started working at EB Games while completing a diploma in Justice. I worked a bit in security and then worked with the Australian Taxation Office in Facilities Management. 

## Interests in IT

Growing up I was always interested in IT and a space nerd. Mum took me to get my first computer (which my sister got jealous) and from there got a real understanding and hobby learning about computers and software programs.  

My first real taste of IT was one and  of my early jobs at a data centre where i worked in security.  I was so fascinated by what each little piece of equipment did and the people working there seemed to love what they did.  

From there I found a passion for the legal system and completed a diploma in Justice while also working at the tax office and hoping to become a police officer. As life progressed I realised back to my original passion I wanted to work in IT.
